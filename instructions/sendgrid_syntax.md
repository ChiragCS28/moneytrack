SendGrid Mail Syntax Guide for App Development
This guide covers the core concepts and syntax needed to effectively use @sendgrid/mail for sending emails in your application. For the most up-to-date information, refer to the official SendGrid documentation: https://sendgrid.com/docs/ and the @sendgrid/mail library documentation: https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs.

1. Core Concepts
Email Delivery Service: SendGrid is a cloud-based email delivery service that provides reliable and scalable email sending capabilities.

Node.js Library: @sendgrid/mail is the official Node.js library for interacting with the SendGrid API.

API Key: You'll need a SendGrid API key to authenticate your requests. Keep this key secure and do not expose it in client-side code.

Email Object: You construct an email object with properties like to, from, subject, text, and html.

Asynchronous Sending: Sending emails is an asynchronous operation.

2. Setup
Create a SendGrid Account: Sign up for a SendGrid account at https://sendgrid.com/.

Generate an API Key: Create an API key with appropriate permissions in your SendGrid account settings.

Install the @sendgrid/mail Library:

bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
Configure the API Key:

javascript
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY); // Replace with your API key
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY): Sets the SendGrid API key. Store your API key in an environment variable for security.

3. Basic Syntax
javascript
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

async function sendEmail(to, from, subject, text, html) {
  const msg = {
    to: to, // Recipient email address
    from: from, // Verified sender email address
    subject: subject, // Email subject
    text: text, // Plain text body
    html: html, // HTML body
  };

  try {
    await sgMail.send(msg);
    console.log('Email sent');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    if (error.response) {
      console.error(error.response.body);
    }
  }
}

// Example Usage
sendEmail(
  'test@example.com',
  'your-verified-email@example.com',
  'Sending with SendGrid is Fun',
  'and easy to do anywhere, even with Node.js',
  '<h1>Sending with SendGrid is Fun</h1><p>and easy to do anywhere, even with Node.js</p>'
);
const msg = { ... }: Defines the email message object.

to: The recipient's email address. Can be a single email address or an array of email addresses for multiple recipients.

from: Your verified sender email address. You must verify the sender email address in your SendGrid account.

subject: The email subject.

text: The plain text version of the email body. This is important for recipients who cannot view HTML emails.

html: The HTML version of the email body.

await sgMail.send(msg): Sends the email message. This is an asynchronous operation, so you should use await to ensure the email is sent before proceeding.

try...catch: Handles potential errors during the email sending process.

4. Advanced Features
Sending Multiple Emails:

javascript
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

const messages = [
  {
    to: 'test1@example.com',
    from: 'your-verified-email@example.com',
    subject: 'Sending with SendGrid is Fun',
    text: 'and easy to do anywhere, even with Node.js',
    html: '<h1>Sending with SendGrid is Fun</h1><p>and easy to do anywhere, even with Node.js</p>',
  },
  {
    to: 'test2@example.com',
    from: 'your-verified-email@example.com',
    subject: 'Another Email with SendGrid',
    text: 'This is another example email sent with SendGrid.',
    html: '<p>This is another example email sent with SendGrid.</p>',
  },
];

async function sendMultipleEmails(messages) {
  try {
    await sgMail.send(messages);
    console.log('Multiple emails sent');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    if (error.response) {
      console.error(error.response.body);
    }
  }
}

sendMultipleEmails(messages);
await sgMail.send(messages): Sends an array of email messages.

Using Templates:

javascript
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

async function sendEmailWithTemplate(to, from, templateId, dynamicTemplateData) {
  const msg = {
    to: to,
    from: from,
    templateId: templateId,
    dynamicTemplateData: dynamicTemplateData,
  };

  try {
    await sgMail.send(msg);
    console.log('Email sent with template');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    if (error.response) {
      console.error(error.response.body);
    }
  }
}

// Example: Send a welcome email
sendEmailWithTemplate(
  'test@example.com',
  'your-verified-email@example.com',
  'd-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx', // Replace with your template ID
  {
    name: 'John Doe',
    city: 'Anytown',
  }
);
templateId: The ID of the SendGrid email template you want to use. You create templates in your SendGrid account.

dynamicTemplateData: An object containing the data to populate the template variables.

Attachments:

javascript
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);
const fs = require('fs');

async function sendEmailWithAttachment(to, from, subject, text, html, filePath, fileName) {
  const attachment = fs.readFileSync(filePath).toString("base64");

  const msg = {
    to: to,
    from: from,
    subject: subject,
    text: text,
    html: html,
    attachments: [
      {
        content: attachment,
        filename: fileName,
        type: 'application/pdf', // Adjust the content type as needed
        disposition: 'attachment',
      },
    ],
  };

  try {
    await sgMail.send(msg);
    console.log('Email sent with attachment');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    if (error.response) {
      console.error(error.response.body);
    }
  }
}

//Example
sendEmailWithAttachment(
  'test@example.com',
  'your-verified-email@example.com',
  'Email with Attachment',
  'Please find the attached PDF.',
  '<p>Please find the attached PDF.</p>',
  './path/to/your/file.pdf',
  'document.pdf'
);
attachments: An array of attachment objects.

content: The base64 encoded content of the file.

filename: The name of the file.

type: The MIME type of the file (e.g., application/pdf, image/png).

disposition: Specifies how the attachment should be displayed (attachment or inline).

Using Custom Headers:

javascript
 const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
 sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

async function sendEmailWithCustomHeaders(to, from, subject, text, html, customHeaders) {
  const msg = {
    to: to,
    from: from,
    subject: subject,
    text: text,
    html: html,
    headers: customHeaders,
  };

  try {
    await sgMail.send(msg);
    console.log('Email sent with custom headers');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    if (error.response) {
      console.error(error.response.body);
    }
  }
}

// Example Usage:
sendEmailWithCustomHeaders(
  'test@example.com',
  'your-verified-email@example.com',
  'Email with Custom Headers',
  'This email has custom headers.',
  '<p>This email has custom headers.</p>',
  {
    'X-Custom-Header': 'Custom Value',
    'X-Another-Header': 'Another Value'
  }
);
headers: An object where the keys are the header names and the values are the header values.

5. Important Considerations
API Key Security: Protect your SendGrid API key. Store it in an environment variable and never expose it in client-side code.

Sender Verification: Verify your sender email address and domain in your SendGrid account to improve email deliverability.

Email Content: Follow best practices for email content to avoid being marked as spam. Use a clear subject line, provide a plain text version of your email, and include an unsubscribe link.

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to catch and log any errors that occur during the email sending process. Inspect the error.response.body for detailed error messages from the SendGrid API.

Rate Limits: Be aware of SendGrid's rate limits and design your application accordingly.

Webhooks: Use SendGrid webhooks to track email delivery status, bounces, and other events.

Dynamic Templates: Leverage dynamic templates to create personalized and engaging email experiences.

Testing: Thoroughly test your email sending functionality in a development environment before deploying to production.
