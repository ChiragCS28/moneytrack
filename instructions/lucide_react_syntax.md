Lucide React Syntax Guide for App Development
This guide covers the core concepts and syntax needed to effectively use lucide-react for incorporating icons into your React application. For the most up-to-date information, refer to the official Lucide documentation: https://lucide.dev/.

1. Core Concepts
Icon Library: Lucide is a collection of beautiful, consistent, and clean icons. lucide-react is the React library for using these icons.

Component-Based: Icons are used as React components.

Customization: You can easily customize the size, color, stroke width, and other properties of the icons using props.

Tree Shaking: Only the icons you import are included in your bundle, which helps to reduce the bundle size.

2. Installation
bash
npm install lucide-react
3. Basic Syntax and Usage
javascript
import { X, Menu } from "lucide-react";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <X />
      <Menu color="red" size={48} strokeWidth={2} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
import { X, Menu } from "lucide-react";: Imports the X and Menu icons from the lucide-react library. You import icons individually as you need them.

<X />: Renders the X icon with default styling.

<Menu color="red" size={48} strokeWidth={2} />: Renders the Menu icon with custom styling.

color: Sets the color of the icon.

size: Sets the size of the icon in pixels.

strokeWidth: Sets the stroke width of the icon.

4. Essential Props
size: The size of the icon in pixels. Defaults to 24.

color: The color of the icon. Accepts any valid CSS color value (e.g., "red", "#FF0000", "rgb(255, 0, 0)", "currentColor"). Using "currentColor" allows the icon to inherit the text color of its parent element.

strokeWidth: The stroke width of the icon. Defaults to 2.

className: Allows you to apply CSS classes to the icon for further styling. This is useful for integrating with CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

style: Allows you to apply inline styles to the icon.

absoluteStrokeWidth: If set to true, the stroke width will not be affected by the icon's size. Defaults to false.

children: Allows you to pass children to the icon, which can be useful for creating custom icons or adding content inside the icon.

ref: Allows you to access the underlying SVG element using a ref.

5. Styling with CSS
You can style Lucide React icons using CSS classes or inline styles.

CSS Classes
javascript
import { X } from "lucide-react";
import "./MyComponent.css";

function MyComponent() {
  return <X className="my-icon" />;
}
css
/* MyComponent.css */
.my-icon {
  color: blue;
  width: 32px;
  height: 32px;
}
Inline Styles
javascript
import { X } from "lucide-react";

function MyComponent() {
  return <X style={{ color: "green", width: 40, height: 40 }} />;
}
Styling with Tailwind CSS
javascript
import { X } from "lucide-react";

function MyComponent() {
  return <X className="text-purple-500 w-8 h-8" />;
}
6. Icon List and Searching
Refer to the Lucide website (https://lucide.dev/icons) to browse the available icons and find the appropriate component name for import. The name of the icon component matches the kebab-case name of the icon on the website (e.g., the "arrow-right" icon is available as the ArrowRight component).

7. Important Considerations
Individual Imports: Always import icons individually to take advantage of tree shaking and reduce your bundle size.

currentColor: Use currentColor for the color prop to make the icon inherit the text color of its parent element, simplifying styling and theming.

Accessibility: If the icon conveys important information, provide alternative text for screen readers using the aria-label or title attribute on the parent element. If the icon is purely decorative, use aria-hidden="true" to hide it from screen readers.

javascript
<button aria-label="Close">
  <X aria-hidden="true" />
</button>
Version Updates: Keep lucide-react updated to benefit from new icons and bug fixes.
